      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Sharmarke Nur. I am a Full-Stack Software Developer with knowledge of the languages HTML, CSS, and Javascript using VS Code. I decided to learn Software Development due to not being fulfilled with where I was at and wanted a change of direction for my life. I have some family who work in the field of tech in IT and felt that was the direction I wanted to go.  An ideal environment I'd utilize my skills is in a team setting. I say that because I feel like I thrive in those settings due to my previous experiences in working apart of a team. One example is a final video project I have done that did really well, generating over 400 thousand views. Being apart of a team, communication and listening to others ideas are vital to being successful in team environment, which is why I feel that being in a team is an environment for me.",
